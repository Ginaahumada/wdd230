            <article>On the Apple Inc. website, the principle of visual hierarchy design is prominently evident through the prominent placement and strategic use of visual elements. From the moment a visitor arrives at the site, Apple's iconic logo and navigation bar immediately capture their attention, establishing the brand identity and providing key navigation options. As they scroll down on the homepage, they encounter carefully selected product images and videos, occupying a central and appealing position. These dominant visual elements direct the viewer's gaze towards Apple's featured products. Headlines and text related to these products are presented in a legible and attention-grabbing manner, further complementing the visual hierarchy by providing relevant and engaging information. Collectively, these design elements create a user experience that effectively guides the visitor's attention to the most important aspects of the page, encouraging intuitive exploration and interaction with Apple's products and services.</article>

            <h3>PARC: Contrast</h3>
            <h4>Spotify</h4>
            <a href="https://www.spotify.com/">Spotify.com</a>
            <img src="images/screenshot3.jpeg" alt="Spotify homepage">
            <article>On the Spotify page, the application of the PARC design principleâ€”Contrast, is clearly evident. This is manifested through the visual differentiation of key elements in the user interface. For example, playback buttons, pause, and music control options are highlighted with vivid color contrast, such as green on a dark background, making them easily distinguishable and accessible to users. Similarly, album covers and artist images are presented in high resolution and vibrant colors, causing them to stand out on the screen and capture the user's attention. This design strategy based on contrast contributes to an effective user experience where key elements are highlighted and instantly recognizable, facilitating navigation and the use of Spotify's music streaming platform.</article>
